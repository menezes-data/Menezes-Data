## 🧠 About Me
Between data, processes, and different ways of seeing the world. 🌍

My name is Matheus de Menezes, and my interest in data comes from something simple: understanding how things work, organizing information, and noticing patterns in everyday life. Before diving deeper into Data Analysis, I was already working closely with processes, controls, and routines that required attention, clarity, and organization.

This desire to learn also took me abroad.
I lived in Ireland, where I learned English and connected with people from different cultures, customs, and traditions. Traveling to other countries further expanded this perspective, showing me that there are many ways to approach problems, make decisions, and organize the world.

📊 It was through this same spirit of discovery that I moved closer to Data Analysis and Business Intelligence. Today, I continue studying through Alura, Tera, and Anhanguera, aiming to use data in a practical way to understand processes, identify improvements, and support everyday decision-making.

I believe data tells stories — and that good questions, even simple ones, can lead to valuable insights.
I keep learning, exploring, and connecting experiences, data, and contexts.

If you enjoy data with purpose, continuous learning, and good conversations, let’s connect. 🤝📊✈️
